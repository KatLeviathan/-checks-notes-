## Description

My motivation for this project was to get a better understanding of API's and really work on getting my pathing to work as i had been struggling before. I feel after this project and working with render I have a better understanding of where things are going wrong and how to fix them when things like the console logs are unable to give a descriptive answer.
I built this project as it was my first time using render and working with properly deployed applications and it was really good practice for helping possible future jobs fixing code or making small websites for little businesses.
I learned a lot about API's and making sure they properly path, I was struggling to get the application to load properly on render and getting to take a second to look over what's actually causing the issues really helped my understanding.
